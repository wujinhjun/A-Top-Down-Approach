# Top Down Approach

As I major in industrial design in SJTU, I had not studied computer networks before. When I made some web app, however, I found I could't handle the target.  
So, I thought I have to learn some basic knowledge of computer networks to meet my needs.

This is a repository to store some code or materials for recording my learning path.
